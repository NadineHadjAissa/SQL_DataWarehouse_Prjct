# 🏗️ SQL Data Warehouse Project

This project is a comprehensive **end-to-end SQL Data Warehouse build**, guided by a hands-on tutorial. It covers the full lifecycle of a data warehousing solution — from requirement analysis and architecture design to ETL development and data modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to design and implement a **modern Data Warehouse** using SQL and best practices. The project simulates real-world scenarios with CRM and ERP data sources, covering Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for clean, structured analytics.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- SQL (DDL, DML, Stored Procedures)
- Git & GitHub
- Draw.io (for architecture design)
- ETL scripting
- Data Modeling (Star Schema)

## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 📁 Bronze Layer
- Raw ingestion from source systems
- Table creation (DDL)
- Load scripts
- Initial data flow documentation

### 📁 Silver Layer
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Cleaned CRM and ERP datasets
- Stored procedures
- Documented transformation logic

### 📁 Gold Layer
- Dimensional modeling
- Star schema with fact and dimension tables
- Business logic implementation
- Final data catalog and flow

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered

- What is a Data Warehouse
- ETL vs ELT
- Data Architecture Design
- Layered DWH Approach (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Star Schema vs Snowflake
- Dimensions vs Facts
- Data Modeling & Documentation
